# Tensorflow Input Pipeline
Accelerators such as GPU and TPU performs much better than CPU in training deep neural network. In order to achieve peak performance, it is important to have an efficient input pipeline that will helps to deliver data for the next step before the current step has finished. `tf.data` API is the tool which helps to build flexible and efficient input pipeline.

# Objective
In this project, the example of using tensorflow input pipeline to feed data to the neural network will be demonstrated.
